# `video_file.py`

## Design Considerations and Enhancements

- **Asynchronous Processing**: Utilizes `asyncio` to handle asynchronous I/O operations, enabling efficient downloading and processing of video files.

- **Concurrent Worker Tasks**: Implements concurrent worker tasks and queues for parallel downloading of video files, improving performance and scalability.

- **Modularity and Extensibility**: Organized into classes and functions, making it easy to extend and maintain.

- **External Libraries**: Employs `fire` for command-line interface and `loguru` for logging.

- **Database Integration**: Interacts with `DatabaseOperations` to update the status of video files in the database.

- **Logging and Error Handling**: Uses `loguru` for comprehensive logging and includes robust error handling to ensure reliable operation during downloading and file identification.

## Module Overview

The `video_file.py` module is designed to manage the downloading and processing of video files. It can download video files based on video IDs retrieved from a database and can identify existing video files in a specified directory, updating the database accordingly. The module leverages asynchronous programming and concurrent workers to efficiently handle multiple video files simultaneously.

    Args:
        worker_id (str): The ID of the worker.

    Raises:
        Exception: If there is an error fetching the video.
    """
```

---

##### Method: `identify_video_files(existing_videos_dir: str) -> None`

Identifies existing video files in the given directory and updates the database.

```python
@staticmethod
async def identify_video_files(existing_videos_dir: str) -> None:
    """
    Identifies existing video files in the given directory and updates the database.

    Args:
        existing_videos_dir (str): The directory containing existing video files.

    Raises:
        Exception: If an error occurs during the identification process.
    """
```

---

### `Fetcher`

Coordinates the fetching of video files using multiple workers.

```python
@dataclass(slots=True)
class Fetcher:
    """
    Coordinates the fetching of video files using multiple workers.
    """
    
    queue_manager: QueueManager
    logger: Any

    def __init__(self):
        """
        Initializes the Fetcher with a new QueueManager instance.
        """
```

#### Key Methods

##### Method: `fetch(self, existing_videos_dir: str = None, num_workers: int = 10) -> None`

Fetches video files using multiple workers.

```python
async def fetch(self, existing_videos_dir: str = None, num_workers: int = 10) -> None:
    """
    Fetches video files using multiple workers.

    Args:
        existing_videos_dir (str, optional): Directory containing existing video files to identify.
        num_workers (int): The number of worker tasks to use for fetching.

## Example Usage

### Prerequisites

- **Python Environment**: Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed.

- **Dependencies**: Install the required packages by running:

  ```bash
  pip install fire loguru
  ```

- **Database Setup**: Ensure that `DatabaseOperations` is properly configured to interact with your database.

### Running the Module

The `video_file.py` module provides a command-line interface through the `cmd()` function. You can use this interface to download video files and process existing video files.

#### Command-Line Interface

To use the module from the command line, navigate to the directory containing `video_file.py` and run it using Python. Below are examples of how to use it.

---

### Fetching Video Files

To fetch video files using multiple workers:

```bash
python video_file.py fetch --num_workers 5
```

- **Parameters**:
  - `--num_workers`: The number of worker tasks to use for fetching (default is 10).

**Explanation**:

- The `fetch` command invokes the `fetch` method of the `Fetcher` class.
- The module retrieves video IDs that need to be downloaded from the database and starts worker tasks to download them.

---

### Identifying Existing Video Files

To identify existing video files in a directory and update the database:

```bash
python video_file.py fetch --existing_videos_dir "/path/to/videos"
```

- **Parameters**:
  - `--existing_videos_dir`: The directory containing existing video files to identify.

**Explanation**:

- The module scans the specified directory for video files and updates the database with information about the existing files.

---

### Fetching and Identifying Simultaneously

You can combine both fetching and identifying existing video files:

```bash
python video_file.py fetch --existing_videos_dir "/path/to/videos" --num_workers 5
```

**Explanation**:

- The module will first identify existing video files in the specified directory.
- Then it will start worker tasks to download any remaining video files that are needed.

---

### Sample Code for Invoking the Fetcher Programmatically

If you prefer to use the module within another Python script, you can invoke the `Fetcher` class directly.

```python
import asyncio
from video_file import Fetcher

async def main():
    fetcher = Fetcher()
    await fetcher.fetch(
        existing_videos_dir="/path/to/videos",
        num_workers=5,
    )

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

**Explanation**:

- This script creates an instance of `Fetcher` and calls the `fetch` method with desired parameters.
- It uses `asyncio.run` to execute the asynchronous `fetch` method.

---

## Additional Notes

- **Database Operations**: The module assumes that `DatabaseOperations` is properly configured to handle database interactions, including methods like `get_video_ids_without_files` and `update_audio_file`.

- **Logging**: The module uses `loguru` for logging. Logs will be output to the console and can be configured via the `LoggerConfig` class.

- **Error Handling**: The module includes robust error handling to manage subprocess errors and file system operations.

- **Concurrency**: Adjust the `--num_workers` parameter according to your system's capabilities to optimize performance.

---

## Understanding the Workflow

1. **Initialization**:
   - The `Fetcher` class initializes a `QueueManager` instance to manage the queue for video files.

2. **Identifying Existing Files**:
   - If an existing videos directory is specified, the module scans the directory for video files and updates the database.

3. **Fetching Video IDs**:
   - Retrieves video IDs from the database that need
